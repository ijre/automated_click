# Hello!

This is a repository for a very simple program which will click on a visual timer. 
The main reason for this is if you require a visual indicator for your clicks, but you either can't show your cursor, are unable to, or you simply need some kind of timer for it.  
  
If you wish to increase the amount of time before it clicks, simply make the window wider.
